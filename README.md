## more cheese please
General Assembly Web Development Immersive Project 2


## About

* Single application for users to create a cheese board and access previously created boards.
* Queries user, cheese, board, and cheese additions databases.


## Requirements:

* Have an API that is securely accessible by your browser app, built using frameworks covered in class.
* Create at least 4 RESTful routes for handling GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE requests. Any actions which change data must be authenticated, and the data must be "owned" by the user performing the change.
* Utilize an ORM to create a database table structure and interact with data
* Use a front-end Javascript app to communicate with your API (both read and write) and render data that it receives in the browser.
* Have semantically clean HTML and CSS
* Be deployed online, so that it is accessible to the public

## Approach:

* Implement basic html and css to test API events from browser
* Complete all RESTful actions on the user, board, and cheeses, databases.
* Incorporate JQuery for browser behavior.
* UI design

## Noteworthy Files:

* index.html
*	styles: index.scss, colors.scss, typography.scss
